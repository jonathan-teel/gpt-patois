            "question": "Describe the social and economic changes that occurred during the Industrial Revolution.",
            "answer": "The Industrial Revolution, spanning the late 18th to early 19th century, led to significant changes. Economically, there was a shift from agrarian economies to industrial and capitalist ones. Socially, urbanization increased, and there were shifts in class structures due to emerging industrialists.",

            "question": "What is quantum computing, and how does it differ from classical computing?",
            "answer": "Quantum computing utilizes principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers which use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in multiple states at once thanks to superposition. This potentially allows quantum computers to solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical computers.",

            "answer": "The Treaty of Versailles, which ended WWI, had significant effects. It assigned blame and heavy reparations to Germany, contributed to economic distress and the rise of Hitler. It also redrew national borders in Europe, contributing to conflicts that would lead to WWII.",

            "answer": "Certainly. At its core, a refrigerator works on the principles of thermodynamics. It uses a refrigeration cycle to transfer heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside, thus keeping the interior cool. This cycle involves the repeated evaporation and condensation of a refrigerant, a process facilitated by the compressor, condenser and evaporator.",

            "answer": "The Industrial Revolution was a time of drastic change. Economically, it marked a shift from agrarian societies to industrial ones, with mass production becoming prevalent. New machinery and technologies boosted productivity, changed employment patterns and gave rise to new industries. Socially, it led to urbanization as people moved to cities for work, affecting family structures, living conditions, and class dynamics. The change was tumultuous, leading to both progress and social issues.",

            "answer": "Quantum computing represents a significant departure from classical computing. Classical computers encode information in binary format (bits) that can either be a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits or 'qubits'. Due to quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, a qubit can exist in multiple states at once and qubits can be linked together, allowing quantum computers to potentially process a vast number of computations simultaneously, providing exponential computational power for certain tasks.",

            "answer": "The Treaty of Versailles was an instrumental factor in shaping the geopolitical landscape of the 20th century. The treaty, signed in 1919, ended World War I but laid the groundwork for future conflicts. The punitive reparations and territorial concessions imposed on Germany created a climate of resentment and economic instability, contributing to the rise of extremist ideologies and leading to World War II. Its effect was far-reaching, fundamentally altering political and economic structures in Europe and setting the stage for a tumultuous century.",
